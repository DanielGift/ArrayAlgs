# ArrayAlgs
Write a class called ArrayAlgorithms.java. It should include two public static methods:
1) repetitions , which takes an array of ints and returns how many repeated numbers there are in the array. So repetitions({1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4}) would return 4.

2) shiftRight , which accepts an array of integers arr and a separate integer s and shifts each element in arr s places to the right. The array should wrap around, so if an element gets shifted past the end of the array, it loops back around to the beginning. It wonâ€™t return anything, but will modify the given array.
	
	int[] a1 = {11, 34, 5, 17, 56};
	
	shiftRight(a1, 2);
  System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a1));
  // {17, 56, 11, 34, 5}
